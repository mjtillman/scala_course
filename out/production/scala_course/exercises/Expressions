1. What is the difference between "Hello World"
and println("Hello World")?

The first is an expression (string literal "Hello World"), the latter is an instruction.

2. What is the value of this code block?
    val someValue = {
        2 < 3
    }

    The value is true because 2 < 3 evaluates to true.

3. What is the value of this code block?
    val someOtherValue = {
        if(someValue) 239 else 986
        42
    }

    The value is 42 because that is the last expression in the codeblock.
    (Python or Ruby does this)
